## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for building the application
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design
- **NextAuth.js**: For authentication
- **OpenAI API**: For AI chat functionality
- **Replit**: For deployment and hosting

## Deployment Information

To move from localhost to live deployment, follow these steps:

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all necessary environment variables are set in your production environment. Review `.env.production` and set the following:
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Your production URL
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A secure random string for NextAuth
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
   - Any other sensitive credentials or API keys

2. **Database**: If you're using a database for user authentication or chat history, make sure it's set up and accessible from your production environment.

3. **Build Process**: 
   - Run `npm run build` to create an optimized production build
   - Use `npm run start` to start the production server

4. **Vercel Deployment**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Replit
   - Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and set up the build configuration
   - Set your environment variables in the Replit dashboard
   - Deploy your application

5. **Custom Domain**: If you're using a custom domain, configure it in your Replit project settings and update your DNS records accordingly.

6. **SSL**: Ensure SSL is enabled for secure HTTPS connections (Replit handles this automatically?).

7. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and error tracking services to keep an eye on your production application's performance and issues.

Remember to test thoroughly in a staging environment before going live, and always follow security best practices, especially when handling user data and API keys.

## Additional Notes

- The application uses Next.js 13 with the new App Router
- Tailwind CSS is configured for styling, make sure to follow the Tailwind directives in your CSS
- NextAuth is set up for authentication, review the configuration in `src/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts` for any necessary adjustments in production
- The OpenAI API is used for chat functionality, ensure your API usage is optimized and within your plan limits
